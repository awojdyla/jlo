# Jlo: Julia Optics

## About
This is a a package made the Julia 
It is inspired by MIP (Matlab image processing), a package that I wrote for Matlab (github.com/awojdyla/mip) and its Python equivalent, COPPY (Computational Optics for Python) github.com/awojdyla/coppy, and to some extent by imageJ 

## usage
'git clone https://github.com/awojdyla/jlo'.
add 'include(Jlo.jl)' to your code and you're good to go
You only need Jlo.jl, really.

## Example of use

Create a gaussian
Propagate using Fourier Optics

ft of a sinewave
pinhole divergence


## To do
Some tools for easy data processing:
bin
crop
pad
resize
rotate
detrend

some sanity checks

czt?
bg removal

A bunch of examples
propagation
lens
talbot effect
wavefront sensing

[display polarization]
[polarization/ rotation matrix]

getting help?
