This module is meat

It is inspired by MIP (Matlab image processing), a package that I wrote for Matlab
github.com/awojdyla/mip and its Python equivalent, COPPY (Computational Optics for Python) github.com/awojdyla/coppy
There's some inspiration from imageJ


Create a gaussian

Propagate using Fourier Optics

Some tools for easy data processing:
bin
crop
pad
resize
rotate
detrend


some sanity checks
ft of a sinewave
pinhole divergence

czt?
removal

A bunch of examples
propagation
lens
talbot effect
wavefront sensing

[display polarization]
[polarization/ rotation matrix]

getting help?
